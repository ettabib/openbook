[Verse 1]
          Ab        Fm
I found a love for me
              Db                            Eb 
Darling, just dive right in, and follow my lead
               Ab           Fm
Well, I found a girl beautiful and sweet
        Db                                      Eb
I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
 
[Pre-Chorus]
                               Ab 
Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
            Fm                      Db               Ab   Eb
Not knowing what it was, I will not give you up this ti-ime
            Ab                            Fm
Darling just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
            Db                     Eb
And in your eyes you're holding mine
 
[Chorus]
      Fm   Db            Ab           Eb              Fm
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Db               Ab      Eb                Fm
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
          Db               Ab                  Eb              Fm
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
         Db               Ab         Eb         
But you heard it, darling you look perfect tonight
