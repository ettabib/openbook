Ebm                     Db   
Hello darkness, my old friend
                           Ebm  
I've come to talk with you again
                      B     Gb  
Because a vision softly creeping
                         B     Gb  
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
        B     
And the vision
                        Gb  
that was planted in my brain
        Gb    Ebm  Gb
Still remains        
           Db         Ebm    
Within the sound   of silence

Ebm                          Db  
In restless dreams I walked alone
                         Ebm 
Narrow streets of cobblestone
                   B        Gb  
'Neath the halo of a street lamp
  Gb              
I turned my collar
       B        Gb  
to the cold and damp
        B                
When my eyes were stabbed
        B              Gb 
By the flash of a neon light
               Gb    Ebm  Gb
That split the night        
                Db         Ebm    
And touched the sound   of silence

Ebm                      Db 
And in the naked light I saw
                           Ebm 
Ten thousand people, maybe more
                 B         Gb  
People talking without speaking
                  B        Gb   
People hearing without listening
               B    

People writing songs
                  Gb   
That voices never share
           Gb    Ebm  Gb
And no one dared        
            Db         Ebm    
Disturb the sound   of silence

Ebm                          Db  
"Fools," said I, "You do not know
                      Ebm  
Silence like a cancer grows
                     B           Gb 
Hear my words that I might teach you
                    B           Gb   
Take my arms that I might reach you."
       B    
But my words
     B                Gb    Ebm
Like silent raindrops fell     
    Gb              Db        Ebm    
And echoed   in the wells  of silence

Ebm                       Db   
And the people bowed and prayed
                     Ebm 
To the neon god they made
                         B      Gb  
And the sign flashed out its warning
                     B      Gb  
In the words that it was forming
                       B           
And the sign said, The words of the
B                   
Prophets are written
              Gb   
on the subway walls
             Gb    Ebm
And tenement halls    
    Gb                 Db   
And whispered   in the sound
   Ebm    
of silence
